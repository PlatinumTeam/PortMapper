Port Mapper
-----------

Unfinished port mapper MBExtender plugin that was going to be included in MBP 1.50. It was never finished due to
a lack of std::thread on 10.6 and overall loss of motivation. The code hasn't been touched in well over a year,
and is a complete mess.

*Note:* This requires the libraries libnatpmp and miniupnp. Include their headers as system and link statically.
